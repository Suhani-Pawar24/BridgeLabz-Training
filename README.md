## 📅 Day 2 – Core Java Scenario-Based Programs
**Date: 30-Dec-2025**

 - 🚀 Overview
 - Today’s focus was on solving real-world Java problems using arrays, loops, and decision-making structures. The goal was to write clean, structured logic with meaningful variable naming.

*Key Concepts Applied:*

 - Control Flow: for, while, and for-each loops.
 - Decision Making: if-else, switch statements.
 - Flow Control: break and continue keywords.

💻 *Scenario Problems Solved*

🌡️ **Temperature Logger**

 - Recorded temperatures for 7 days using an array.
 - Calculated the average and identified the maximum temperature.
 - Used if conditions for value comparisons.

🚆 **Train Reservation Queue**

 - Developed a menu-driven ticket booking system using switch.
 - Enabled multiple bookings via a while loop.
 - Implemented a break condition to stop booking once seats reach zero.

🏋️ **Sandeep’s Fitness Challenge Tracker**

 - Stored daily push-up counts for a full week.
 - Utilized a for-each loop to calculate the total and average reps.
 - Applied the continue keyword to skip rest days (zero reps).

🎬 **Movie Ticket Booking App**
 - Processed inputs for movie type, seat category (Gold/Silver), and snacks.
 - Nested if statements within a switch block for complex pricing.
 - Handled multiple customer transactions using a loop.

📚 **Rohan’s Library Reminder App**
 - Calculated late fines at a rate of ₹5/day.
