# BridgeLabz Training — Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

## Branch: dsa-practice

🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Mastery
This section documents my journey into the core of computer science: Data Structures and Algorithms. As part of my BridgeLabz training, I am shifting focus from "how to model an object" to "how to store and process data efficiently."
